Description: Decision curves are a useful tool to evaluate the population impact
    of adopting a risk prediction instrument into clinical practice. Given one or
    more instruments (risk models) that predict the probability of a binary outcome,
    this package calculates and plots decision curves, which display estimates of
    the standardized net benefit by the probabilty threshold used to categorize
    observations as 'high risk.' Bootstrap confidence intervals are displayed as
    well. This package is a companion to the manuscript 'Assessing the Clinical
    Impact of Risk Prediction Models with Decision Curves:  Guidance for Correct
    Interpretation and Appropriate Use' by Kerr et. al.
