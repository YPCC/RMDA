Description: Decision curves are a useful tool to evaluate the population impact
of adopting a risk prediction instrument into clinical practice. Given one or more
instruments (risk models) that predict the probability of a binary outcome, this
package calculates and plots decision curves, which display estimates of the
standardized net benefit by the probability threshold used to categorize observations
as 'high risk.' Curves can be estimated using data from an observational cohort, or
from case-control studies when an estimate of the population outcome prevalence
is available. Bootstrap confidence intervals are displayed as well.
