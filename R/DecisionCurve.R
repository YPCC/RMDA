#' Generate and plot decision curves.
#'
#' Decision curves are a useful tool to evaluate the population impact
#' of adopting a risk prediction instrument into clinical practice. Given one or
#' more instruments (risk models) that predict the probability of a binary outcome,
#' this package calculates and plots decision curves, which display estimates of
#' the standardized net benefit by the probabilty threshold used to categorize
#' observations as 'high risk.' Bootstrap confidence intervals are displayed as
#' well. This package is a companion to the manuscript 'Assessing the Clinical
#' Impact of Risk Prediction Models with Decision Curves:  Guidance for Correct
#' Interpretation and Appropriate Use' by Kerr et. al.
#'
#' Functions in this package include:
#'  \code{\link{decision_curve}},
#'  \code{\link{summary.decision_curve}},
#'  \code{\link{plot_decision_curve}},
#'  \code{\link{plot_clinical_impact}},
