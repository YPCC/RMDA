This is implemented in the package with the addition of the 'policy' argument to function decision_curve.\n\n\nv 1.3\n========================\n * fixed bug in the inputs for createFolds for cv_decision_curve.\n\n* allowed for multiple curves to be plotted together when one curve has CI’s and the other doesn’t\n",
